Credit Default Summary – Azure Data Pipeline (Medallion Architecture) + Power BI

A complete end-to-end Azure Data Engineering project demonstrating ingestion, transformation, aggregation, and reporting of credit-risk data using:

Azure Data Factory (ADF)

Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS)

Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)

Power BI for insights & reporting

This project uses real public data from the UCI Default of Credit Card Clients dataset.

🎯 1. Business Objective

Credit lenders need to understand:

Which clients are most likely to default

How default rates differ across education, gender, and client groups

Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:
✔ Total Clients
✔ Total Defaults
✔ Average Default Rate

This project builds a production-style Azure data pipeline and a Power BI dashboard to deliver those insights.

🗂 3. Dataset (Bronze Layer)
Source:

Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset – UCI Machine Learning Repository
🔗 https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/350/default+of+credit+card+clients

Raw file used (Bronze):
data/bronze/Credit_Clients.csv


30,000 client records

Variables:
SEX, EDUCATION, LIMIT_BAL, PAY_0..PAY_6, BILL_AMT1..6, PAY_AMT1..6, and Y (default flag)

🔄 4. Data Pipelines (Azure Data Factory)

This project uses three pipelines:

4.1 pl_copy_raw_to_bronze

Copies raw data (Credit_Clients.csv) into the Bronze container of ADLS.

4.2 pl_run_df_bronze_to_silver

Executes the Bronze → Silver Data Flow:

Cleans column names

Selects required fields

Removes invalid/null rows

Writes cleaned output to Silver layer as:

data/silver/silver_credit_clients.csv

4.3 pl_run_df_silver_to_gold_credit_summary

Executes Silver → Gold Data Flow:

Groups by education and gender

Calculates:

total_clients

total_defaults

default_rate

Creates readable labels

Writes final aggregated output to:

data/gold/credit_summary.csv

⚙️ 5. Data Transformations (ADF Data Flows)
5.1 Bronze → Silver Data Flow (df_bronze_to_silver)

Steps:

Source: srcBronzeCreditClients
→ Reads Credit_Clients.csv

selectColumns:
→ Renames UCI raw columns & selects relevant attributes

filter1:
→ Removes rows with invalid/blank client_id

sinkSilverCreditClients:
→ Saves output to silver_credit_clients.csv

5.2 Silver → Gold Data Flow (df_silver_to_gold_credit_summary)

Steps:

Source: Cleaned Silver dataset

aggDefaultByEducation:

Groups data by education and sex

Computes totals & default metrics

derivedColumn1:

Assigns readable labels (gender_label, education_label)

sinkGoldCreditSummary:
→ Saves aggregated output to credit_summary.csv

📊 7. Power BI Dashboard
File
powerbi/Credit_Default_Summary.pbix

Key KPIs

12K total clients

2,873 defaults

15.18% average default rate

Included Visuals

Bar chart: Average Default Rate by Education Level

Stacked bar: Education × Gender Default Comparison

KPI cards: totals and percentages

Slicer for gender-based filtering

📈 8. DAX Measures (Examples)
Total Clients = COUNTROWS('Credit')

Total Defaults =
CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('Credit'), 'Credit'[Y] = 1)

Default Rate =
DIVIDE([Total Defaults], [Total Clients])
